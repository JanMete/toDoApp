To Do List app created with Vite where customer is able to add new elements (only when input have more then 0 letters), mark the elements as done and delete the elements. All the elements are stored as an objects in useState array. To delete the element I used filtering array method, data from the objets are passed as props to component and maped into an HTML element.

For styling I'm using here Styled Components library - https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components

Also in this project I used TypeScript that I learned from "Understanding TypeScript" course created by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy - https://www.udemy.com/course/understanding-typescript/#instructor-1
